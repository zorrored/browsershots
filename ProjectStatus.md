    * Software version milestone:0.3.0.
    * Still not feature-complete, but development has switched to 0.4.
  * Version 0.2: http://v02.browsershots.org/
    * Software version milestone:0.2.6.
    * Stable but unmaintained.

## Volunteers wanted ##

I am looking for volunteers who want to run a screenshot factory for the new version 0.5. The screenshot factory software is still in development, so patience and maybe some experimentation are required. Python skills are useful, but not required. If you want to help, have a look at HowToCreateNewShotFactory, then write email to [johann@browsershots.org](mailto:johann@browsershots.org).
