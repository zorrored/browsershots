Users are those who submit their web site URLs for testing.

**Interface:** Users can simply use the web frontend through their browser. Use of a web proxy is encouraged and works just like with any other web site.

**Hardware/Software:** We have tried to make the service as accessible as we could. Your screen resolution should not make too big a difference. But because the purpose of Browsershots is to show you screenshots of different browsers, you will need a browser that can display images. And because we don't like JPEG artefacts, we use the PNG format which some older browsers don't understand.

**Bandwidth:** The bandwidth requirements are moderate because the scaled-down screenshot previews are around 70 kilobytes each.
