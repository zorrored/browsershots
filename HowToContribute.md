Here's a number of things that you can do if you want to help out.

## Improve the documentation ##

The documentation for Browsershots is in a Trac Wiki. This means that you can edit it online. Choose a nickname and send email to johann@browsershots.org to receive a password.

## Run a screenshot factory ##

If you have some cheap bandwidth and a computer that is running most of the time, set up a factory and let it start making screenshots. You can use our screenshot factory reference implementation in Python, or you can write your own in your favorite programming language.

If you want to run a screenshot factory, see HowToCreateNewShotFactory and sign up with the [browsershots-factories](http://lists.browsershots.org/mailman/listinfo/browsershots-factories) mailing list.

## Submit bug reports, feature requests, patches ##

If you find a problem or have any idea for improvement, [create a ticket](http://trac.browsershots.org/newticket) in the Trac system.

The source code for this project is available from the Subversion repositories or in the released ZIP files. If you want to improve the software, fix bugs or add features, you can download or checkout the source from http://svn.browsershots.org/ and send patches to johann@browsershots.org.

## Translate Browsershots to your language ##

See HowToTranslate for more information.

## Donate through PayPal ##

You can send money to [johann@browsershots.org](mailto:johann@browsershots.org) through PayPal if you want to support the project. I also have a bank account in Germany, so if you want to transfer money directly, send email and ask for details. Financial support will accelerate the project development considerably. I am a full-time student and work on Browsershots in my spare time, but I have to take closed-source jobs to pay the rent and the server bills.

## Bookmark, blog, send feedback ##

As with most open-source projects, positive feedback from visitors can be a great motivation factor. Some people have already added the project to their [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) bookmarks, and some have blogged about it. That's good because it gives some traffic, and it shows us that people like the idea.

Postcards, pizza, proposals can be sent to Johann C. Rocholl, Allmandring 3F122, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany.
