Translations for Browsershots are maintained in Launchpad. You're welcome to help translate Browsershots to make it more accessible:

https://translations.launchpad.net/shotserver/0.4/+pots/shotserver

On the translated pages, your language will appear in the language selector in the top right corner, and it will be automatically selected if the browser's language settings are properly configured. Your translation will be licensed under the GNU GPL like the rest of the project.

There's also a [mailing list](http://lists.browsershots.org/mailman/listinfo/browsershots-i18n) for translation questions.
